time settings
    total time 100.0 s
    -> linear ramp-up 0.0 - 20.0
    -> constant flow for inlet in time 20.0 - 100.0
    -> prescribed log-profile for terrain category 4 using the 3s gust values: 1.05*28.7*(z/10)**0.2
    
    time step 0.02 s    
    -> comply with CFL condition 
    -> have at least 20-25 time steps / estimated period of relevant frequency signal (here vortex shedding -> anticipated T=10s)
        ==>> take minimum of both conditions above 
    -> 5000 time steps in total

output
    every 0.5 s -> at least 15-20 (here 20) outputs per estimated period of relevant frequency signal (here vortex shedding -> anticipated T=10s)
    equivalent to every 25th time step
    -> 200 output steps
    -> on nodes: PRESSURE (scalar - 1 component), VELOCITY (vector - 3 components), REACTION (vector - 3 components)
        ==>> results in binary format: cfd.post.bin -> 2.9 GB: generated by running the simulation
    -> indexing the results: cfd.post.bin.idx -> 24.2 MB: generated when first opening the binary result file in GiD

    drag files -> some text format -> information written at every time step
    -> visualize the custom file with plot_custom_aerodynamic_force_results.py
    -> Fx = base shear (after ramp-up) = 1.25e8 N -> 125 x 10^3 kN 
        ==>> see Slides 4_5 handouts for a square cross section in similar flow conditions -> 159 x 10^3 kN
    -> My = base overturning moment (related to Fx, after ramp-up) = 4.2e10 Nm -> 42 x 10^6 kNm 
        ==>> see Slides 4_5 handouts for a square cross section in similar flow conditions -> 56 x 10^6 kNm

from aerodynamic force plot -> circa T=10s -> f=0.1Hz -> with circa U=60m/s at 2/3H -> estimated St=0.1
